                    <p>The start of tech career began with me learning about coding. I was introduce to languages like HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT,  PYTHON. But mostly worked with HTML, CSS, and little JavaScript which is front-end development of software engineering. The website that was created was called "CopIT" which is The Premier Fashion Identifier App. Continuing my knowledge in tech I also came across Digital Marketing where I learned about SEOs, inbound marketing, and using social media platforms to increase engagement. Also understanding the importance of branding. Having both UX/UI design to help understand how the users will interact with the product and accessing the overall function as well. D'ANOMALY was the first piece of content that incorporate digital marketing. My interest in this fellowship is learning how to create and develop and fully functional front-end and back-end websites. Understanding the function for each code in different languages, how to approach a project in a more creative way rather than so my UI desgins comes out more clean cut and nice to look at. Having all the codes runs smoothly so when an interaction happens with the buttons or elements the anitmation takes place. Also learning how to applications that can help teach coding to those that is having an hard time picking up and grasping somes information once in a while. Or simply just remebering terminology behind the codes itself. Having the opportunity to further my knowledge in web data science will give me the power over the data I control and how to search for the solutions I need when facing troubles, understanding that each code have to called in order to run properly. How to get ahead of the curve and stay ahead to find better soultions.</p>
